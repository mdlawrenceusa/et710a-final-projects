				 <p>  A supercar is one of the highest classes for cars. These cars are typically the best of the best, and are in extremely limited quantities. Supercars are exotic cars, and that means they have great style, as well as incredible performance. These cars are among the fastest in the world, and have the best sport handling out there. A supercar has a certain mystique associated with it. They are usually limited to a certain amount of vehicles built, that way there is some type of exclusivity to own one. Not only is the price usually in the hundreds of thousands, but it becomes a status symbol to own one of these cars.
		<br><br>
The most expensive sports cars in the world that you are used to hearing about are the quintessential supercars. A Ferrari GT, Audi R8, Lamborghini Murcielago, the Pagani Zonda, the list goes on, but these all qualify as being supercars. They all share many similar features, but their engines are where they truly make the cut. Many of these cars have the horsepower of three or more cars put together. Some of them have horsepower numbers higher than 1,000. V8 engines are nothing compared to the normal V10 and even V12 engines that supercars usually have.
